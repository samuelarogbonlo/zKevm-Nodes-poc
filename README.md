## Overview

![Architectural Overview](https://github.com/samuelarogbonlo/astar-poc/assets/47984109/f520a4d7-4016-48f5-96cd-fe41aef530c5)

This project outlines the process to create a Proof Of Concept of a simple architecture with 2 zKyoto RPC nodes behind a load balancer exposing a public endpoint and communicating internally through a private network.
